# Digital Office
The digital office app for employees leveraged the Smplrspace viewer to let users search for points of interest (POIs) such as printers, coffee machines, toilets, or a colleague's desk.
After finding an item, the user should be able to select it to visualise the path to get there from a pre-defined departure point of your choice
